<h2>Pymaceuticals-Inc-Capomulin-Drug-Trial</h2>
In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens. The gathered data was then cleaned, analyzed, and visualized using Python with the help of Matplotlib, Pandas, and Scipy.
<h4>Data Sources</h4>
The data for this project comes from two CSV files. The first CSV contains the metadata of the mice that participated in the drug trial. The metadata includes a mouse ID, weight, sex, age in months, and the drug regimin used to treat the mouse.
<mouse_metadata>

The second CSV contains the results of the drug trial. The data is a time series which details the number of metastatic sites and tumor volume for a given mouse at a particular point in time. 
<study_results>

<h4>Data Preparation</h4>
First, the 2 CSV files were loaded into Python and merged on the mouse ID into a single dataframe titled 'merged_data'. 
<merged_data_raw>
  
The resulting dataframe was then checked for duplicate rows. This revealed that there were duplicate rows for mouse g989. All rows corresponding to mouse g989 were therefore dropped from the 'merged_data' dataframe. After dropping mouse g989 from the dataset, there were 248 mice included in the data.

Next, the tumor volume data was summarized in terms of mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and standard error and stored in new dataframe called 'tumor_volume'.
<summary_stats>
<summary_stats_df>

<h4>Data Visualization</h4>
Using the original data and leaving out data for mouse g989, a bar graph showing the number of mice that were involved in each drug trial was created using Matplotlib.

A pie chart showing the sex of the mice in the trial was then generated using the original mouse metadata.

In order to analyze the final results of the study, the 'merged_data' dataframe was altered such that only the final tumor volume measurement was included. This data was then stored in the 'max_time_data' data frame.
<final_timepoint>

The final tumor volumes for each mouse that underwent treatment with the drugs 'Capomulin', 'Ramicane', 'Infubinol', and 'Ceftamin' were then gathered from the 'max_time_data' dataframe and stored in 'tumor' dataframe.
<final_tumor_volume>
<final_tumor_volume_df>

In order to test for outliers in the tumor volume data in the 'tumor' dataframe, the upper and lower quartiles and the interquartile range were calculated. For the purposes of this analysis, an outlier is defined as any data point whose value is greater or less than the the upper or lower quartiles, respectively, by at least a factor of 1.5 times the interquartile range.
<IQR>
<outliers>

As shown in the screenshot above, only one outlier, belonging to the Infubinol dataset was found. This was confirmed by plotting the data from the 'tumor' dataframe in a box and whisker plot.

Next, mouse l509 was singled out in order to analyze the effects of a Capomulin treatment regime. 
<capo_treatment>

The 'merged_data' dataframe was then filtered for mice who underwent the Capomulin treatment regime. The mean tumor volume was then calculated for each mouse in the regime and stored in the 'cap2' dataframe. The aggreagated tumor volume was then plotted on a scatter plot.
<capo_scatter>
<capo_treatment_all>

<h4>Correlation Testing</h4>
First, linear regression analysis was used to determine the r-value, p-value, and standard error of the mean for the tumor volume data in the Capomulin drug trials.
<capo_stats>

Next, the line of best fit from the linear regression was plotted over the previous scatter plot.

<h4>Conclusions</h4>

# Mice who underwent treatment with Capomulin had, on average, a significantly smaller final tumor volume than mice who underwent treatment with Ceftamin or Infubinol. However, the mice who were treated with Capomulin had roughly the same final tumor volume as those treated with Ramicane. This data, illustrated in the box and whisker plot, may be skewed by the fact that only the final recorded time point for each mouse was taken into account. This final recorded time point varied greatly from mouse to mouse, with some final timepoints being as low as 0, while others were as high as 45. This skew appears to be least present in the data for mice treated with Capomulin as evidenced by the fact that the lowest maximum time point value for mice in this regiment is 10. Further analysis of the final timepoints would be necessary in order to make a more definitive statement.

# Mouse l509 was singled out for an analysis of how its tumor volume progressed over time. Mouse l509 was an ideal candidate for such an analysis because its tumor volume was measured throughout the entire range of time points (0 - 45). Although the tumor volume increased between time points 0 and 20, it decreased drastically in the remainder of the time frame. In the course of the study, the initial tumor volume of mouse l509 decreased by 7.8% (45 mm3 at time point 0 and 41.5 mm3 at time point 45). Although this decrease suggests that the Capomulin regimen helped to reduce tumor volume for mouse l509, it is not certain that other factors did not play a role in the measured decrease. A further analysis and comparison of other individual mice who were treated with Capomulin from time point 0 to time point 45 would provide more meaningful insight into the efficacy of Capomulin.

# As evidenced by a correlation coefficient value, r, of 0.842. there is a strong positive correlation between the weight of a mouse treated with Capomulin and its average tumor volume. This implies that the efficacy of Capomulin correlates negatively with the weight of the mouse being treated. A closer look at the statistical analysis reveals that this dataset is reliable. This dataset has a p-value of only 1.32 x 10-7, meaning that the data is statistically significant. The data also has a relatively low standard error of 0.128, meaning that the mean of this sample only differs from the mean of the population by 0.128.
